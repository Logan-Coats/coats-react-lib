# COATS-REACT-LIB
---
coats-react-lib is a component library for react, which I will use to help myself learn more about component libraries, CSS, HTML and React. (Also hoping to create fun documentation for it and use it in my own website)
I am working on this in my free-time outside of my current full-time position and will update it when I can.
